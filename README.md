# nicotine-surge-iceland
The number of outlets selling nicotine pouches and vapes in Iceland has increased fivefold between 2023 and 2025. The project aims at mapping the spread of sellers.
## Back to 1989? Iceland's Youth and the New Nicotine Boom
The idea was to look into the increase in licensed retailers selling nicotine pouches and vapes in Iceland in the last years. 
I could only find numbers from 2023 to compare with the latest numbers, so I used those. I found out that the increase in sellers is fivefold in two years, from 34 nicotine vendors to 170. The use of nicotine pouches in the age group 18-29 is up to 33 percent, the same percentage as daily smokers of cigarettes in 1989.
## Data
Data collected are lists of licenced vendors from 2023 and 2025

## Overview of the data analysis process
The project was supposed to be quite simple, only using a couple of lists as data. The first thing I had to do was to change the pdf-files into google-spreadsheets. Then I found out lat and lng for all the retail places using chatGPT and google maps to help. Finding the correct coordinates took a bit longer than I thought, but it worked out in the end. After finding the coordinates I could import the lists to geojson. As it turned out I skipped that step and imported the csv-file directly into datawrapper. Naming the columns correctly and setting the file up so datawrapper could read it properly. All of this took longer than I thought.  
## What I could have done
I donÂ´t know enough Illustrator to be able to make this look better, so the maps are a bit basic. I focused on finishing, rather than trying to make it look good.
